I am a Postdoctoral researcher in [Micro and Nano Mechanics Group](https://micronano.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, USA, working with [Prof. Wei Cai](https://web.stanford.edu/~caiwei/). I obtained my PhD in Mechanics from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland where I worked with [Prof William Curtin](https://people.epfl.ch/william.curtin?lang=en) in [Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics Modeling](https://lammm.epfl.ch/). I completed B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India.  

My research interests broadly revolve around understanding the atomistic mechanisms that govern the deformation of crystalline materials. In particular, characterization of the effects of various crystal defects (vacancy, dislocation, solutes etc.) on the overall mechanical properties of crystals by performing quantum scale (Density Functional Theory), atomistic scale (Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo), meso scale (Dislocation Dynamics) simulation is the main focus of my research works. Recently, I have started exploring the applications of emerging machine learning techniques in accelerating and augmenting the atomic scale modeling of materials.
